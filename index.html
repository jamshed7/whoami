        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <!-- <p>The following are the programming languages I currently know:</p> -->
        <p>Python, C++, C, C#, JavaScript (ES6), Java, ARM Assembly</p>

          Among these, Python is by far my favorite language, and is the language I try to use most often.
          C# is the newest language that I know, I like to use it when I am making ðŸŽ® with Unity!
          C and C++ are the only two language I learned in school, and are the ones that I most frequently use for school work. I also am working with OpenGL for my capstone project, and have been using C++ a lot recently.

          I can make websites and apps. I typically like working on the backend of things, and I enjoying developing my backend using NodeJS and the Express Framework.
          My #1 reason for this is the massive NPM library!

          As you can see I have a bunch of random things listed on here. To summarize, my preferred development environment is UNIX.
          I like to write code in text editors over IDE's, and Atom is my favorite text editor!
          Ever since I started writing stuff in C#, I have also been using Visual Studio a lot.
          And ahh yes, I do know how to use MS Excel. I know what you're thinking, finally a software engineer that can use excel...

        <p>
          An Augmented Reality Sandbox that uses an Xbox Kinect to scan the 3D surface of a sandbox in real-time and projects topographical lines using a short-throw projector onto the sand surface to highlight mounds and valleys.
          A high-end computer processes the data from the Kinect to draw the projection lines using OpenGL before sending it to the projector. (Group)
